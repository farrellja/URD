# URD

**URD** is an R package designed for reconstructing transcriptional trajectories underlying specification or differentiation processes in the form of a branching tree, using single cell RNA-sequencing data. It is named after the [Norse mythological figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdr) who nurtures the world tree and decides all fates.

**URD** is described in:<br />
[Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700225)<br />

## Installation

- To install, follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

## Example Code

- To get started, check out the Quick Start Tutorial: ([View](Analyses/QuickStart/URD-QuickStart-AxialMesoderm.md)) ([Download](Analyses/QuickStart/URD-QuickStart-AxialMesoderm.Rmd))

- The full supplementary analysis from Farrell & Wang, *et al.* that describes the reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis (3.3-12 hours post-fertilization) is also [available](Analyses/SupplementaryAnalysis).

- The full supplementary analysis from Siebert, Farrell, *et al.* that describes the reconstruction of developmental trajectories in adult Hydra is also [available](https://github.com/cejuliano/hydra_single_cell).

- A tutorial for plotting the processed data from Siebert, Farrell, *et al.* (see below for download) is available [here](https://github.com/cejuliano/hydra_single_cell/blob/master/URD_Hydra_Plotting_Tutorial.md)

## Processed Data to Explore

- The processed URD object from zebrafish embryogenesis (3.3 - 12 hours post-fertilization) from Farrell & Wang, *et al.* can be downloaded from the [Broad Single-cell Portal](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/data/public/SCP162/single-cell-reconstruction-of-developmental-trajectories-during-zebrafish-embryogenesis?filename=URD_Zebrafish_Object.rds) (requires log-in).

- The processed URD objects from adult Hydra from Siebert, Farrell, *et al.* can be downloaded from the [Broad Single-cell Portal](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP260/stem-cell-differentiation-trajectories-in-hydra-resolved-at-single-cell-resolution) (requires log-in) or from [Data Dryad](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.v5r6077).
